"""The `hook-observation` record family — the kernel-owned per-call telemetry contract (docs/297).

Every hook invocation can append ONE schema-tagged JSONL line to the workspace's
observation log (`.dos/metrics/observations.jsonl`): which verb fired, what it
decided, how long it took. That log is the only surface that knows the
**denominator** — how many tool calls the substrate adjudicated at all — so it is
what turns the absolute "DOS caught N things" count into the rate an operator
actually wants ("light touch or nanny?", issue #24).

The family was born on the plugin's Go binary (docs/276 Part 2). THIS module is
the docs/297 Option-B move: the kernel takes ownership of the contract — the
schema constants, the entry builder, the fail-soft writer, the tolerant reader,
and the pure rate fold all live HERE — and every hook runtime that wants its
calls counted (the Go binary, the Python hook verbs) is a *conforming writer*.
The kernel never knows WHO wrote a record; it reads its own contract. That keeps
the awareness arrow clean: nothing here names a plugin, a vendor, or a binary.

Design rules (the `lane_journal` / `posttool_sensor` postures):

* **Pure where it can be.** `observation_entry()` and `intervention_rate()` are
  data-in / data-out, no disk — the unit-test surface. Only `append()` and
  `read_observations()` touch the file, at the boundary.
* **FAIL-SOFT, ADVISORY (docs/99).** Telemetry about a decision is strictly
  downstream of the decision: `append()` never raises, so a write fault can
  never change an emitted dialect or an exit code. A torn line is "didn't
  happen," never a corruption that derails a read.
* **Byte-clean (docs/138).** Every counted field is env-authored — the hook
  wrote the record downstream of an already-decided verdict. No agent narration
  enters the numerator or the denominator.
* **Like-for-like only (the issue-#24 caveat, made structural).** The rate fold
  takes observation records and nothing else. The lane journal — a different
  log with a different window and scope — has no path into it.

The denominator rule (docs/297): a `delegate` record is a HANDOFF, not an
adjudication — the call's real verdict is (or will be) another record, written
by the runtime that actually decided it. So `adjudicated` excludes delegates,
which is the one rule that counts each call exactly once in all three writer
worlds (binary-only, Python-only, mixed).
