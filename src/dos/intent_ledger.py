"""The intent ledger — a third durable surface for *declared intent + adjudicated progress* (docs/107 §3).

> **The WAL answers "what was decided about leases." The intent ledger answers
> "what was the run trying to accomplish, and how far did the *evidence* say it
> got." The first is the kernel believing only effects; the second is the kernel
> storing a self-report so it can later distrust it against the fossils.**

DOS already records what a run **decided** (`lane_journal`: leases taken, dropped,
evicted) and what it **committed** (git ancestry). It records nothing about what a
run was **trying to do** and **how far it got** on the part that isn't a commit
yet — so when a run crashes mid-flight, a successor cannot *continue* it (only
`SCAVENGE` its lane). This module is the missing log: an append-only, `fsync`'d,
replay-foldable record of **declared intent** and **progress beats against it**,
one per run, keyed by `run_id` from birth.

It is `lane_journal`'s sibling, deliberately byte-mirroring its ARIES discipline
(`docs/107 §3`):

  * **Same shape, different subject.** `append`/`read_all`/`replay`/`compact`,
    `fsync` on write, torn-tail tolerant (`read_all` skips ONLY the torn final
    line, keeps a mid-file `_CORRUPT` sentinel). Where `lane_journal` folds to a
    *live-lease set*, this folds to a *declared-intent + verified-step set* (the
    `LedgerState`) the pure `resume.resume_plan` consumes.
  * **Different key, which closes a gap as a side effect.** Keyed by `run_id`
    (the ledger lives at ``.dos/runs/<run_id>/intent.jsonl``, next to `run.json`),
    NOT by `(loop_ts, lane)`. So the `(loop_ts,lane)→run_id` join `94 §7` /
    `journal_delta`'s "HARD PROBLEM" flagged is *sidestepped* — the resumption
    data is in a log keyed by `run_id` from the start. The WAL stays exactly what
    it is (lease correctness); this carries the run-scoped progress it was never
    meant to hold.

**The epistemic spine** (`docs/107 §3.2`, the `103`/`102` move): the asymmetry
between `STEP_CLAIMED` (the agent's say-so — *content*, distrusted) and
`STEP_VERIFIED` (a minted belief over git ancestry — *structure*, trusted). Replay
reads `STEP_VERIFIED`s as done and treats every `STEP_CLAIMED` without a matching
`STEP_VERIFIED` as **not done** — fail-closed. This module holds the *vocabulary,
the writers, and the pure replay fold*; the `STEP_VERIFIED` MINT (re-verifying a
claimed SHA against ancestry on the non-forgeable rung) is a CLI-boundary helper
(it does git I/O), exactly as `liveness`'s evidence-gather is a boundary, not the
pure verdict. The pure verdict over a `LedgerState` lives in `dos.resume`.

Write is library-only and happens UNDER the run's own writer (the dispatch loop /
a driver), each run owning its own file — there is no cross-run contention, so
unlike the WAL there is no shared mutex to hold (one writer per `run_id`). `O_APPEND`
+ `fsync` is the durability floor.
